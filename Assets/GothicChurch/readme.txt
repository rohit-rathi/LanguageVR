To obtain a nice shadow effect for the interior, activate the "WindowsCutout" gameobject located inside the prefab and de-activate it's renderer component, 
and move the "Windows" gameobject to another layer and render it separately with a secondary camera. (works with dynamic shadows, baked lightmaps and also with sunshafts effect if you have pro)
Also, you need to de-activate the "Exterior" gameobject to get the light to shine into the interior.

The doors are separate meshes with pivots, ready for animations.

Thanks for buying :D:D
